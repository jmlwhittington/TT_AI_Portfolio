	<p>*   *   *</p>
    <p class="tbc">Queen Medb's desire for the brown bull of Cooley drove her to wage war on the Ulster kingdom.</p>
    <p class="ic">When the dragon is seen in the field, it signifies the right time for the application of virtue.</p>
    <p class="ay">The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.</p>
    <p class="tbc">The armies clashed and the noise of their battle was like thunder rolling across the land.</p>
    <p class="tdc">With trust and without confusion, righteousness has no place to depart.</p>
	<p>*   *   *</p>
    <p class="ic">The way of the gentleman may be expressed or withheld, spoken or unspoken.</p>
    <p class="apom">As I lay there upon the soft, warm grass, I thought of the many strange things that had happened to me.</p>
    <p class="ay">We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.</p>
	<p>*   *   *</p>
    <p class="tbc">Cú Chulainn was the champion of Ulster and fought valiantly against all odds.</p>
    <p class="ic">Treading on frost, the ice is approaching.</p>
    <p class="apom">He had not expected to be nearly so excited as he was.</p>
	<p>*   *   *</p>
    <p class="ay">The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.</p>
    <p class="tbc">The hero's great feats in combat were spoken of in songs and tales, preserving his legacy for generations.</p>
    <p class="tdc">The soft and weak overcomes the hard and strong.</p>
