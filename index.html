    <h1>J. M. L. Whittington's AI Project Portfolio</h1>
    <p>A showcase of generative AI exercises performed throughout the Fall 2024 semester of ENG6806: Humanities in the Age of AI. A copy of the syllabus is <a href="https://anastasiasalter.net/HumanitiesAISyllabus/">here</a>, which includes the generative exercises for your understanding of each week's product. You may also learn more about me through visiting either the <a href="https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_Website_Demo/">website I made for ENG6800: Introduction to Texts and Technology</a> or <a href="https://jmlwhittington.com/">my primary website</a>.</p>

  <section id="bonus-projects">
    <h2>Bonus Projects</h2>
	<p>Some freebies I felt like throwing in, generated in my (sparse) free time!</p>
    <div class="card-container">
    <a href="https://chdr.cah.ucf.edu/gra/justin/index.html" target="_blank" class="card">
	    <h3>My Center for Humanities and Digital Research (CHDR) Profile Page</h3>
		<p>My first real experimentation with webpage generation, hosted on a GitHub repo and easily updatable via HTML frames; I wanted to see how much labor could be saved and how well ChatGPT followed creative instructions like "give me a color scheme and design inspired by the West Virginia state flag"</p>
	</a>
    <a href="Bonus/Bonus_One/index.html" class="card">
	    <h3>CatGPT</h3>
		<p>Joke c(h)atbot that I couldn't rest until I had created; essentially a very simplistic Markov chain text generator and an early experiment in text and webpage generation</p>
	</a>
	<a href="Bonus/Bonus_Two/index.html" class="card">
	    <h3>Suno Music(?) Generations with My Brother</h3>
		<p>Toward the end of the final semester of my master's program and before a short summer break involving a move across the country to start a PhD program, my brother and I played (and I mean that quite literally) around with a large investment of credits in Suno he made</p>

  <section id="project-ideas">
    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
	<p>A few ideas I've been kicking around for the future, which might be possible in the last few weeks of the semester or over winter break.</p>
    <div class="card-container">
      <div class="card">
	    <h3>Using ChatGPT to develop <i>Minecraft</i> mods</h3>
		<p>Despite knowing other programming languages, I don't know Java well enough to develop mods. But I have an interest in doing so, especially to keep certain mods up-to-date since the game lacks official mod support and updates tend to break mods. <a href="https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/2249">Some of my research</a> has focused on the possibility space of modding to ethically reshape certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_rhetoric">procedural rhetorics</a> of games. If ChatGPT can assist with this, it opens the floodgate to those without programming expertise.</p>
	  </div>
      <div class="card">
	    <h3>Further music/sound experiments</h3>
		<p>Not just in <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a>, but also in <a href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/music-fx">Music FX</a> and any others I come across that seem worthwhile. I have a background in music (broadly) and audio design for games (less extensively), one I thought I'd left behind when I entered undergrad. Suno reignited a flame that's been trying to spark for years now. There are definite possibilities here...</p>
