    <h1>West Virginian Video Generation</h1>
    <p>A series of examples playing with video generative AI. The following samples three different tools (Runway, DeepAI, and invideo) attempting to animate a '40s photograph from a small town in West Virginia, the West Virginia state coat of arms, and the state flag, respectively.</p>

    <h1>Runway - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saturday_afternoon_street_scene._Welch,_McDowell_County,_West_Virginia._-_NARA_-_541004.jpg" target="_blank">"Saturday afternoon street scene. Welch, McDowell County, West Virginia"</a></h1>
    <p>A first iteration of merely describing the scene wasn't nearly interesting enough, so I prompted again in a second iteration by describing a more panicky scenario. With only slightly more movement, this is nonetheless better:</p>

    <h1>DeepAI - West Virginia Coat of Arms</h1>
    <p>After a failed attempt to get Runway to animate the coat of arms, I tried other tools. I described the scene in hopes that, even though it was cartoonish, something might get picked up and animated. This was the only example across any tool that came close.</p>

    <h1>invideo - Text-to-Video Prompting of "Animate the West Virginia State Seal"</h1>
    <p>Hoping that some model might hold some information within that it can access despite not being provided a source, much like I'd taken advantage of with ChatGPT, I sought out a text-to-video generative AI. I did at least discover how all those spammy videos on social media are generated so quickly.</p>
