    <h1>Machine Learning Model for Genre Prediction of Video Game Covers from Sixth-Generation Consoles</h1>
    <p>A <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Teachable Machine</a> model trained on thirty sixth-generation console (PS2, original Xbox, GameCube, roughly equally distributed) game covers across three genres (platformer, roleplaying, and adventure; again, roughly equally distributed), input into an interface for testing new examples.</p>
	<p>There are two iterations of this: the <a href="Original/index.html">first</a> merely features a confusion matrix that updates with each successive input; the <a href="Advanced/index.html">second</a> introduces a fourth category ("Low Confidence") for anything guessed under 75% on all categories, as well as a second confusion matrix for second-most guessed categories for tracking patterns.</p>
